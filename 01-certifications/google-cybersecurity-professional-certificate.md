# Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate

## Status
Completed

## Why I undertook this certification
I completed the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate to establish strong, vendor-neutral foundations in cybersecurity concepts, terminology, and workflows before specialising in cloud security.

This certification helped me understand how security functions operate in practice, particularly across detection, response, and risk management.

## Core areas covered
- Security principles and defence-in-depth
- Threats, vulnerabilities, and risk
- Incident response lifecycle
- Security monitoring and logging concepts
- Identity and access fundamentals
- Basics of networking and operating systems
- Introductory Python for security automation
- Governance, risk, and compliance concepts

## Key concepts that translate directly to cloud security
- **Least privilege access**  
  Identity and access controls as a foundational security mechanism.
- **Logging and monitoring**  
  The importance of visibility for detection, investigation, and response.
- **Incident response workflows**  
  Preparation, detection, analysis, containment, eradication, and lessons learned.
- **Risk-based decision making**  
  Prioritising controls based on impact and likelihood rather than checklist compliance.

## Relevance to AWS and cloud security
While vendor-neutral, the certificate established mental models that apply directly to cloud environments, including:
- Identity-based access control (mapped later to AWS IAM)
- Centralised logging and alerting (mapped later to CloudTrail, CloudWatch, and Security Hub)
- Understanding attacker behaviour and detection signals
- Security ownership across shared-responsibility environments

## Reflections
This certification provided a strong conceptual baseline but reinforced the need for hands-on, platform-specific security engineering skills — which I am now developing through AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials and practical AWS labs.
